# Relative Reddit Comments

Spot great Reddit comments by adding color-coded badges that measure relative awesomeness

## Introduction

Reddit comment threads are hard to read. Relative Reddit makes great comments easy to spot within a thread by adding a color-coded badge next to each comment's score. The brighter the color, the better the comment.

99% of Reddit comments are responses to other comments. That's what makes a conversation in Reddit. But there are nuggets of brilliance buried in these comment threads that we skim over because they are 2 or 3 levels deep. When someone responds to another comment with a witty joke or brilliant comeback, a heartfelt story, or maybe the answer to a question, you want to know about it. Relative Reddit will highlight these comments so that you can easily spot them as you scroll through a comment list.

Relative Reddit works by comparing a comment's score to the score of the comment it's responding to. A typical comment receives about half the upvotes that its parent did, as Redditors stop reading a thread and thus stop upvoting. Take the following example:

* (1,000 upvotes) <comment one>
    * (500 upvotes) <comment two>
        * (800 upvotes) <comment three>

In this example, whatever was posted in comment three is worth reading because it got 1.6x the number of upvotes that its parent comment got! For whatever reason, people love this comment. Relative Reddit makes it easy to spot such a comment when it comes along with a color-coded badge.
